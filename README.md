# Vehicle Registration Dashboard (Investor View)

An interactive Streamlit dashboard built on public Vahan data to analyze registrations by vehicle category and manufacturer, with YoY and QoQ growth.

# Setup Instructions
1) Clone & install

git clone https://github.com/Shweeee/Backend_Internship
cd vehicle-reg-dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt

##  Run the app

streamlit run app.py

##Load data

Expected columns:

Year, Category Group, Vehicle Class (manufacturer or class), Subcategory, Registrations

Optional for QoQ: Month or Quarter (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4)

## Features

Filters: Date range, Category, Manufacturer/Vehicle Class

KPIs: Total Registrations, YoY %, QoQ % (if quarter data available)

Charts: Yearly trends, Quarterly trends, Manufacturer breakdown

Investor-friendly layout

## Calculations

YoY% = (CurrentYear - PreviousYear) / PreviousYear * 100

QoQ% = (CurrentQuarter - PreviousQuarter) / PreviousQuarter * 100

QoQ is shown only when quarter/month data is provided.

## Data Assumptions

‚ÄúVehicle Class‚Äù serves as manufacturer/class depending on Vahan export.

Missing/invalid numerics are coerced to 0 for aggregation.

If quarter data is unavailable, QoQ will display N/A.


## Data Collection 

Source: Vahan Dashboard public pages


Cleaning: header fixes, type coercion, deduplication
